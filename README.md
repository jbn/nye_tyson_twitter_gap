This repository contains the data and notebook I used to write [Partisanship, Nerd-love, and Race](https://medium.com/@generativist/partisanship-nerd-love-and-race-2aed018f4a16). I anonymized the data because Twitter corporate doesn't like it when you share data. If you use it, please link this repository. If you're an academic, please check back in a bit, since I'll probably try to turn this into a formal paper -- and, citations are apparently lifeblood.
